# Java Snake Game

## Overview
This is a classic **Snake Game** built in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
The project demonstrates how to design a simple yet modular game by breaking it down into multiple classes for game logic, rendering, and event handling.

## Features
- Classic snake gameplay with movement controls.
- Food generation at random positions.
- Score tracking as the snake eats food and grows.
- Collision detection with walls and itself.
- Game-over and restart functionality.

## OOP Concepts Used
- **Classes & Objects**: Separate classes for Snake, Board/Game Panel, Food, and Main Game Logic.
- **Encapsulation**: Game state (snake position, direction, score) kept inside classes with controlled access.
- **Abstraction**: High-level game logic separated from low-level rendering details.
- **Inheritance (if applicable)**: Using parent classes or interfaces for reusable behaviors.
- **Composition**: The Game class composes Snake and Board classes to form a working game.
